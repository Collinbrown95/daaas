# Custom Webapps

We can deploy anything as long as it's open source and we can put it in a Docker
container. For instance, NodeJS apps, Flask or Dash apps. Etc.

    We just push these kinds of applications through Github into the server.
    The source for the above app is here [github.com/StatCan/covid19](https://github.com/StatCan/covid19)



# How to get your app hosted

If you already have a webapp in a git repository, then as soon as it's
Dockerized, we can fork the Git repository into the StatCan github repository
and point a url to it. To update it, you'll just interact with the Statcan
Github repository with Pull Requests.

**Contact us if you have questions.**

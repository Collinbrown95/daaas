## Just send a pull request!

All you have to do is send a pull request to [our R-Dashboards
repository](https://github.com/StatCan/R-dashboards). Include your repository in
a folder with the name you want (for example, "air-quality-dashboard"). Then we
will approve it and it will come online.

If you need extra R libraries to be installed, send your list to [the R-Shiny
repository](https://github.com/StatCan/shiny) by creating a Github Issue and we will add the dependencies.

# Embedding dashboards into your websites

    We have not had a chance to look at this or prototype it yet,
    but if you have a use-case, feel free to reach out to engineering.
    We will work with you to figure something out.
